Solutions to the UBC CPSC 310 course project are considered
private and should not be shared on public repositories.

The readings and pre-recorded videos for CPSC 310 at UBC
are licensed using CC-by-SA. However, it is important to
note that the lecture videos, slides, deliverable
descriptions, code implementing the deliverables, exams,
and exam solutions are considered private materials. We
go to considerable lengths to make the project an
interesting and useful learning experience for this course.
This is a great deal of work, and while future students may
be tempted by your solutions, posting them does not do them
any real favours. Please be considerate with these private
materials and not pass them along to others, do not make
your repos public or post them to other sites online.
